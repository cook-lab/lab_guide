# Cook Lab Guide

## Overview

The Cook Lab is based at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) and University of Ottawa. We combine single-cell and spatial genomics with patient-derived experimental models to decode gynecologic disease and develop new strategies for treatment, diagnosis, and prevention.

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. David Cook (dacook@ohri.ca)
- Scientist, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute
- Assistant Professor, University of Ottawa

## Research Directions

### Ovarian Cancer
- **Treatment Resistance:** Understanding how ovarian tumours acquire resistance to therapy
- **Rare Subtypes:** Characterizing rare ovarian cancer subtypes to understand their distinct biology and how they differ from high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)
- **Malignant Transformation:** Understanding how endometriosis can progress into ovarian cancer

### Endometriosis
- **Cellular Microenvironment:** Understanding how the cellular microenvironment of endometriosis contributes to disease pathology and its relationship to malignant and inflammatory diseases
- **Novel Therapeutics:** Developing immunotherapeutics for endometriosis
- **Diagnostics:** Exploring new diagnostic approaches based on circulating biomarkers (protein, methylated DNA profiling)

## Core Technologies

- **Single-cell genomics** (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq)
- **Spatial transcriptomics** (imaging-based and sequencing-based platforms)
- **Patient-derived experimental models**
- **Computational/bioinformatics analysis**

## Team Composition

The lab includes postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students, and research staff.

## Key Resources

- **Ottawa GynePath Biobank:** Co-founded with Dr. Sony Singh (2025) - biospecimen resource for gynecologic disease research

## Notable Work

- **Spatial Touchstone Project:** Published in *Nature Biotechnology* (2025), establishing best practices for imaging-based spatial transcriptomics

## Lab Conventions

### Code & Analysis
- Primary languages: R, Python
- Version control: Git/GitHub
- See [Analysis Standards](guides/analysis_standards.md) for workflow guidelines
- See [Visualization Style Guide](guides/visualization_style_guide.md) for plotting standards

### Analysis Projects
Every computational analysis should include:
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Research questions and goals
- `ANALYSIS_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan (the anchor document)
- `ANALYSIS_LOG.md` - Living log of completed work
- Numbered scripts (`00_`, `01_`, etc.) for reproducibility
- Phase reports with embedded statistics and figures

### Templates & Resources
- [Project Spec Template](templates/project_spec.md) - For defining new research projects
- [Report Template](templates/reports/00_report_template.md) - Phase report structure
- [Report Rendering](templates/reports/) - Quarto config, Makefile, render script for PDF output

### Data Management
- *[Add data storage and sharing conventions]*

### Communication
- *[Add preferred communication channels and meeting schedules]*
